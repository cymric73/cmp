# About	

Custom Markdown Page (CMP) builds upon several open source projects to provide a simple method of using portable plain-text files to create professionally typeset documents.

This project by combines:
- [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) as the base content authoring language
- [Showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/docs/markdown-syntax/) to support [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github) and some extra goodies
- [Markdown Page](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page) to deliver it all in a minimal single-file package
- [Latex.css](https://latex.now.sh), a Latex-inspired base CSS theme
- A few extra CSS tweaks, such as numbered headings.

## How it works

Create beautiful & portable documents using two universaly available tools, any plain-text editor & a modern web browser. No other applications or on-line editors are needed. Just author Markdown in your favourite plain-text editor and view in the browser.   
 
View the source of this document to get started, or click here to view a "text" version. Just three (3) lines of **code** are required to enable the **CMP format**.    

With just a bit of Markdown knowledge, or by following the examples below, you can easily create portable and professionally typeset documents.
